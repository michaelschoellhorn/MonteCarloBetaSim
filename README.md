# MonteCarloBetaSim
MonteCarlo simulation of an electron beam hitting solid matter. Physical features include moeller-, mott-scattering and the continuous slowing down approximation for modelling energy loss in cases with deflection under theta = 0.2 rad. The simulation can be used to model electrons with kinetic energy between ionisation energy and pair formation energy.

## Visualization
For the visualization of the taken paths, one can run plot.py in the visualization directory after running the simulation. The python moduls matplotlib and numpy are needed, aswell as a working python installation. The paths of the electrons are color coded with their energy.
